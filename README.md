## About ##

PROV-XML-View is a visualisation tool to create provenance graphs from PROV-XML notation in accordance with PROV Graph Layout Conventions. It allows users to visually verify their PROV-XML code. The tool runs in any javascript-enabled web-browser.

This tool was developed as part of the "From apps to labs" Flinders University High Value Data Colelction project supported by the [Australian National Data Service](http://www.ands.org.au/)
